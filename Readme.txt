Assumptions and Considerations in the project
  
  1. No collision detection logic was put in. 
  2. TODO comments represent the developers intention for "ideal" solution 
  3. Proper DI practices were not implemented...
  4. The structure of the project is only to show intend. Ideally the application could be split into multiple projects
